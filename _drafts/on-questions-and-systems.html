<p>A cornerstone of my science education has been that it isn't right to let your interest in a particular organism or system drive your work; that the proper way to conduct research is to start with a broad biological question and <em>then</em> find a suitable model in the natural world for answering that question. It's something that has always made me vaguely uneasy -- my interest in biology originated from an intrinsic interest in very specific organisms and ecosystems and places, and so it seemed that perhaps I lacked an appropriately scientific mindset.<em> </em>I would argue (to myself) that a deep interest in the particular weird and wonderful varieties of life on earth was a powerful tool in discovering just what questions were interesting and essential in seeing research get off the ground, but I remained uneasy, thinking perhaps I lacked the more theoretical curiosity of an academic biologist. Recently, however, I've realized that whether or not that was once true, my unifying interest across continents and biotas is biogeography, and that certainly qualifies as sufficiently removed and theoretical. Whether this is a marker of maturity as a student or just the inevitable result of four years of education is up for debate,  but it touches on something important: to what extent is a science determined by its methods and its mode of thought, and to what extent is it determined by the nature of its subject of study?</p>
