<em><br />
Backcountry skiing is for anarchists and coyote angels.</em><br />
-C.L. Rawlins</p>
<p>On Monday I was contemplating skiing to Aspen. The Saturday before I hoofed it out of Gothic with my brother, dumped him at the bus stop in Gunnison, and skied to the Friend's Hut in a snowstorm, a 32-mile effort that probably wouldn't win me any accolades for wisest taper but gave me a feel for what a long, long night it was going to be. </p>
<p>On Monday I skied around Gothic Mountain, big and beautiful sentinel of my winter, framed in my window every morning with alpenglow and snowplumes and crenelated buttresses of metamorphic rock. A comforting return to the ineffable satisfaction of the circumanvigation. </p>
<p>The winter is winding down but its end is still two months away. I blame my twitchy legs on a desire for liberation. </p>
