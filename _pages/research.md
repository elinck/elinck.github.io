I'm an evolutionary biologist and ornithologist broadly interested in how the geological and ecological features of landscapes drive differentiation in avian populations. As a member of the <a href="http://klickalab.com" target="_blank">Klicka Lab</a> at the University of Washington and <a href="http://www.burkemuseum.org/" target="_blank">Burke Museum of Natural History &amp; Culture</a>, much of my work is based in ornithological specimen collections, whether as source of data on morphological variation or as a source of DNA for genome-wide analyses. However, I also draw on everything from traditional field observation to emerging biodiversity informatics and remote-sensing datasets. 

## Ecological drivers of speciation

My dissertation research is focused on the influence of natural selection on the differentiation of New Guinean tree kingfishers _Syma torotoro_ and _Syma megarhyncha_, sister species that replace each other along elevational gradients. While tropical mountains feature as both hotspots of species richness and the site of dramatic changes in environment along elevational gradients, it's unclear whether different selection pressures across these gradients are sufficient to cause speciation in groups generally thought to have high gene flow (e.g., birds!). In order to test whether disruptive selection drove speciation in _Syma_, I'm investigating island-wide patterns of genetic and morphological differentiation in both taxa, conducting species delimitation, and reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among geographically distinct populations. Currently, I'm focusing on investigating the phylogeographic structure of _Syma torotoro_ as a visting researcher at the California Academy of Sciences, using DNA extracted from the toepads of historical museum samples with so-called "ancient DNA" methods, and a novel method of reduced representation whole genome sequencing appropriate for ancient DNA known as <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151651">hyRAD</a>. 

## Phylogeography and population genomics

At its simplest, evolution is merely a change in the allele frequency of a specific gene in a specific population. From this microevolutionary building block all deeper levels of evolutionary relationship are formed -- which make population genetics a crucial field for understanding the origin of avian biodiversity. Phylogeography, or the spatially explicit study of genetic variation across landscapes, is particularly useful, as it can shed light on the correlation between geographic and environmental processes and genetic differentiation. I have previously explored the influence of dispersal ability on phylogeographic structure in an island songbird (The Louisiade White-eye) using traditional PCR and Sanger Sequencing methods. Currently, I'm working with two reduced-representation whole genome sequencing methods (RADseq and UCEs) as tools to explore the phylogeography of North American mountain songbirds at fine spatial scales. 

## Natural history museum specimen collections

Natural history museum specimen collections are an undervalued and underutilized source of huge amounts of biological data, with the potential to inform research in fields ranging from systematics and taxonomy to virology and toxicology. In addition to using vouchered tissues in phylogenetic research and actively contributing to collecting efforts and specimen preparation at the Burke Museum (and occasionally CAS), I have used aggregated specimen records to infer migratory patterns in Painted Buntings.
