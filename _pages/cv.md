## About:

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Klicka Lab, located in the Department of Biology and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the University of Washington, Seattle. A National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellow, I study <a href="https://elinck.github.io/research/">evolution and population genetics of birds</a> using museum specimens, field observation, and genomics. I'm also a <a href="https://elinck.github.io/writing/">science writer</a>, <a href="https://elinck.github.io/writing/">competitive trail runner</a>, and expat Vermonter.
