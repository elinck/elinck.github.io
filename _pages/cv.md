## About:

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate and National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellow in the Klicka Lab, located in Department of Biology and the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture at the University of Washington. I study evolution and population genetics of birds using museum specimens, field observation, and genomics. I'm also a science writer and competitive trail runner, and expat Vermonter.
