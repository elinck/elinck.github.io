<p>It was a long day on my feet with <a href="http://seekingultra.blogspot.com/">Luke</a> and Ben yesterday, connecting up the Yakima skyline route with Umtanum Creek Canyon via Old Durr Road, the original wagon route between Yakima and Ellensburg. 27-odd miles and about 6K' of climbing, but slow going: we had 10 miles of unrunnable, relentless clay mud that somehow lay conjugally with water ice; cross country travel that included a steep descent to the canyon requiring veggie belays, and two miles of bushwhacking in pricker bushes while incessantly fording a frigid creek. Fun! I tried to imagine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Of-Men-Mountains-William-Douglas/dp/1447400135">William Douglas</a> doing similar rambles in his Yakima boyhood, and that helped, a little.</p>
<p>What really helped was that it was magnitudes less miserable than racing <a href="http://www.rainshadowrunning.com/capitol-peak-mega-fat-ass.html">Capitol Peak 50K(+) Mega Fatass</a> the week prior. It's a great community event, and one of the oldest ultras in Washington, but I'm hard pressed to imagine a more unpleasant bit of running given the conditions. Torrential rain, temperatures in the mid-30s and low 40s, 15-foot mud puddles of uncertain depth. I chased an imaginary front runner unnecessarily hard for 3 hours before Max Ferguson caught up and told me I was in the lead, then ceded it to him and ground out a 2nd-place, 4:26 finish, thinking only of the end. I'm running low on base this time of year, and felt pretty thrashed as a result, but that was pretty predictable. </p>
<p>I'm overdue for some low-impact training, but this ominously warm winter is wreaking havoc on my seasonal rhythms. I tried to follow up the suffering with some schussing, heading out Sunday to meet my brother at a snowbound yurt up Icicle Creek, only to then watch it downpour all day on the previous night's 15 inches of fresh snow. Better luck this weekend, I hope. I'll just pretend it's June.    </p>

<p>It was certainly a treat to break above the inversion and into brilliant sunlight. Less so to descend back into it a few miles later; the sensation was akin to walking into a meat locker. </p>

<p>Complaints aside, any time I make it to the sagebrush sea -- here at its northernmost extent -- I am content. </p>
