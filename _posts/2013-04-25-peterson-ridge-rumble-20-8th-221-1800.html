<p>First, a disclaimer: I have a bit of a policy about excessive gastrointestinal detail in race reports, but sometimes that's just how things go. I’ll be as brief as possible in that unfortunate realm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.petersonridgerumble.com/">Peterson Ridge Rumble 40</a> was my first ultra back in 2011. As I’m about to graduate (and possibly close out my chapter as an Oregonian), I thought the 20-miler would be a nice race to start off my season with, and a bit more forgiving of the low-volume training necessitated by thesis-writing than the 40.</p>
<p>We caught a ride with <a href="http://williegmcbride.blogspot.com/">Willie</a> and drove over Santiam Pass from Salem area, arriving at Suttle Lake (where Marta had arranged a cabin) around 6. It was a full-on blizzard on the pass, but this let up to gentle snowfall at the lake. Still, perhaps a bit cold for Chacos, but it's hard not to be aspirational in your dressing when you're headed to the dry side. The small cabin was wonderfully warm, and there was a big otter (!) rolling around on the dock at sunset. Grilled cheese and fries for dinner, after a similarly lardy lunch. This proved to be a poor choice.</p>
<p>The next morning we left at the civilized hour of 7:45 for the 20 minute drive to Sisters, grabbed some coffee at Sisters Coffee Co., and arrived at the school. Fast-race nerves kicking in, I unsuccessfully spent 20 minutes trying to clear my stomach before doing some strides and lining up for a 9AM start. Following the "gun," I lead for the first mile or so, feeling a little goofy, but also not wanting to get caught up in the pack. After maybe 10 minutes, the eventual winner<a href="http://www.salomonrunning.com/us/team/mendoza.html"> Mario Mendoza</a> caught up, and we ran together for a stretch, but I soon realized I wasn't going to be able to hang on, and he pulled away once we reached the first section of singletrack. It's a mostly flat, fast course, with steep little rocky climbs and descents punctuating smooth trails looping around the Peterson Ridge area, and as I hit the first of these climbs I realized my stomach was going to be a huge liability. By 30 minutes, I was slowing way down, and in the throws of severe gastrointestinal distress.</p>
<p>I tried to grit it out and run at a reasonable pace, but eventually looked back and saw third place was rapidly closing in, my legs refusing to respond and my morale taking a hit. We ran together for maybe five minutes, and then I had to let him go as well.</p>
<p>Something had to give, and I bolted off the trail to hide behind a rocky buttress and attend to an urgent physiological need that could no longer be ignored. By the time I emerged, places 4 and 5 were running past, and so I fell in with them, feeling much better. We chatted for a bit and then, feeling cocky, I attempted to make a move and put some distance on them. But before the gap stuck, my tempestuous stomach returned with a vengeance, and they leapfrogged back as I bolted for more cover. Whilst indisposed, the first place woman and another male runner shot past, leaving me to my eventual finishing place. I spent the final ~10 miles trying to gain on them and passing assorted 40 mile runners before finally catching sight of them during the final road mile.</p>
<p>400 brutal meters on the track, and it was over. I crossed the line in 2:21:23 and 8th place (of 258 runners). Mario, the winner, finished in about 2:11, but places 2 - 8 were within 4 minutes of each other, in a very fast, competitive race. I will no longer be so complacent about pre-racing meals.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://animalathleticspdx.com/">Animal Athletics</a> for the support, and Willie, Tim, Marta and Kate for rides, shelter and company.</p>
