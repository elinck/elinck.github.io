<p><a href="http://beyondtheranges.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/chihuahua_grizzly_2.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1075" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/chihuahua_grizzly_2.jpg" alt="chihuahua_grizzly_2" width="1200" height="802" /></a></p>
<p>The photograph above depicts the last known Mexican Grizzly (a now-extinct subspecies of brown bear endemic to northern Mexico and the American southwest; <em>Ursus arctos nelsoni</em>), shot in 1957 and paraded through the streets of Ciudad Chihuahua. </p>
<p>Both the photograph and the bear's extinction have always struck me as unspeakably sad, which is why I've long wanted to write on the topic. Now, I've had the chance: This month's issue of the <a href="http://www.hypocritereader.com/">Hypocrite Reader</a> (an online magazine where I've <a href="http://hypocritereader.com/31/on-singing">contributed</a> <a href="http://hypocritereader.com/33/counting-birds">previously</a>) includes an <a href="http://www.hypocritereader.com/39/el-oso-plateado">essay of mine</a> about its loss, animals in the imagination, and the singularity of landscapes, among other things. I hope you enjoy it. </p>
