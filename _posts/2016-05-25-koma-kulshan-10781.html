<p>I’m currently in San Francisco as a visiting researcher at the <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/">California Academy of Sciences</a>, a position that gives me a month and a half at one of my favorite institutions in a vibrant city, but sadly cut spring and summer skiing in the Pacific Northwest short. A few weeks ago, in anticipation of the move and a premature end to the season, I took a Thursday off to climb and ski Koma Kulshan (Mt. Baker; 10,781’) with <a href="http://www.highpressurephotography.com/">Erik</a>, via the Easton Glacier. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.skimountaineer.com/CascadeSki/CascadeSki.php?name=Baker">Easton Glacier route</a>, though heavily crevassed, is a popular ski -- popular enough that I joked with Erik that I was surely the only skier in the Northwest to have knocked out both the <a href="https://beyondtheranges.wordpress.com/2016/03/08/skiing-across-the-enchantments/">Enchantment</a> and <a href="https://beyondtheranges.wordpress.com/2016/05/14/chiwaukum-traverse/">Chiwaukum</a> traverses in a day, but not this relatively straightforward objective on one of our sentinel stratovolcanoes. Regardless, it’s a truly classic line: 7,700’ of more or less uninterrupted descent from the summit, with superlative views of the North Cascades and Puget Sound. </p>
<p>Leaving Seattle at 4AM, we were skinning by 6:30, on the summit 5 hours and 40 minutes later, and back to the car for beers and potato chips in <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/559605250">7:45 elapsed or so</a>. The snow on the relatively steep Roman Wall was just about perfect corn; below 7K things got mushy, as only to be expected on route spanning such a large elevational gradient. The most notable aspect of the conditions we encountered was a thick cloud band that had us skiing by braille from 4500' to 6500' and made for surreal views up high. </p>
<p>Back under grey skies in Seattle for a formal dinner that evening, it was hard not to feel a little smug. </p>
