<em>Jake contemplates the appropriate technique for managing frozen avalanche debris as Mt. Baker looms in the distance </em></p>
<p>Compared to last year's grim meterological stakes, the 2015/2016 winter has been a relative bonanza for skiers in the Pacific Northwest. Starting in late fall and picking up serious steam in the final weeks of 2015, a series of cold North Pacific storms have hammered the Cascades, resulting in snow levels frequently dropping to 2000' or below. Because of this, the *real* story of the season has been the proximity of exceptional skiing to Seattle, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBgAydtKYG6/?taken-by=ethanlinck">frequent 4:30AM wake-ups to snag 3000' of powder before work</a>. But back in November, a couple of trips further afield provided profligate eye candy for my dutiful X100. </p>
<p>Kicking things off, Jake and I knocked out a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/438896069">short circumnavigation</a> of Table Mountain in the Mt. Baker sidecountry. It's hardly a committing undertaking, but I don't think there's a better short ski tour in the world. I've already been back to repeat it with Sarah and Kate. </p>

<p>Following that (<a href="https://beyondtheranges.wordpress.com/2016/01/30/nicaragua-and-the-interoceanic-grand-canal/">and my trip to Nicaragua</a>), Kate and I observed tradition to meet college friends Ben and Hannah outside Bend. We managed to skin a few laps at Mt. Bachelor, but more notably ticked another spectacular Cascadian shield volcano, the often-overlooked Paulina Peak / Newberry Crater (7985'). At 14 miles round trip, it was an excellent introduction to training for this year's <a href="http://www.elkmountainstraverse.com/">Elk Mountain Grand Traverse</a>, which I'll be tackling with fellow RMBL winter caretake and close friend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alpenflow/">Peter</a> come March.</p>

<em>Newberry Crater from Paulina Peak.</em> </p>
<p>We closed out 2015 with a trip to visit Kate's parents in Colorado over the winter holidays, and were treated to a week of gorgeous skiing in the Gore Range and the Sawatch Range, confirming that yes, aspens and thin air and still make my heart ache nostalgic. </p>

<p><em>Celebrating an early New Years. </em></p>
<p>All of which is old news, but in the midst of a frantic few months, something worth pausing to reflect on. And be thankful for. Why else have a blog?</p>
