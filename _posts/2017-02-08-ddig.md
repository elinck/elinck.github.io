title: NSF DDIG awarded!

I recently learned from my program officer at DEB-Evolutionary Genetics that my application
for a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5234"> National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG)</a> --
"Investigating genomic signatures of speciation in tropical montane kingfishers (Aves: Halcyonidae)"
was recommended for funding. I'm very grateful for the support, and excited
at the opportunity to get to the field and collect whole-genome sequence data.
