<p>The good folks at the <a href="http://www.hypocritereader.com/">Hypocrite Reader</a> -- "an online monthly, of essays conceptual and timely, based in Brooklyn, New York" -- were kind enough to publish an essay of mine in their August issue, "Strategies of Togetherness." </p>
<p>It's about a dearly missed friend, the Colorado Plateau, and singing, and it's available <a href="http://www.hypocritereader.com/31/on-singing">here</a>, along with many excellent pieces. </p>
