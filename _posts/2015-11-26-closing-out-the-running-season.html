<p>Fall is typically the low point in my seasonal flux of training effort. This year, it seems to the low point in my seasonal flux of <em>blogging</em> effort as well. But now that snow is falling and I've developed a backlog of photos from more interesting trips to report on, I thought I'd jot something down about the last three races of the year.</p>
<ul>
<li>In late August, I headed home to Vermont for my hometown hillclimb, the <a href="http://www.rtttovt.com/">Race to the Top of Vermont</a>. Despite having substantially less preparation going into the event than I did in 2014, I managed a 15 second PR, finishing in <strong>2nd place in 36:30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Bailing on a fall 100, I signed up for the <a href="http://whiteriver50llc.com/CrystalMountainSkyMarathon">Crystal Mountain Skymarathon</a> as a consolation prize, and then spent three weeks nursing a nasty bout of achilles tendinitis and barely running. By race day, it had improved some, and I stubbornly decided to go for it (said every runner, ever). The tendon held up, sorta, but running substantially harder than I had the fitness for brought on massive cramping around mile 20. I ended up jog-walking the last 6 miles to cross the line <strong>6th place in 4:30.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After thus reaggravating my tendon and being forced to take a few weeks completely off from running, I managed to heal up and start getting out casually again. A couple of weeks later, I was sufficiently motivated to jump into the final <a href="http://www.seattlerunningclub.org/Events/Cougar/cougarmtn1.html">Cougar Mountain Trail Series</a> race of the year, running to <strong>4th in :51:39 in the 7.6 miler</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other running-related news, I published an essay in <em>High Country News</em> back in October,<em> </em>in response to an op-ed claiming trail runners were <a href="http://www.hcn.org/articles/grand-canyon-runners-are-missing-the-point">"missing the point."</a> It's available <a href="http://www.hcn.org/articles/anger-against-trail-runners-public-lands-Mt-Rainier-Wonderland-Grand-Canyon-response">here</a>.</p>
