title: A new home for BTR

It's been over a year since I last posted at [Beyond the Ranges](http://beyondtheranges.wordpress.com.).
I'm a little sad about this. My old blog was a labor of love, the one 
real reminder I have that I love taking photographs, and the archive of a half decade
of adventure between the end of college and the present day. There are a number of reasons I couldn't keep it up:
Writing for *The Stranger* and my subsequent increase in freelancing cut in to my desire 
to pen 3000+ lyrical words about sliding on snow. My own interest in reading about running and skiing has diminished 
decreased lately. Blogs appear to be older. I needed to start a real professional website (this), and 
wanted a single home on the internet, but BTR was a bit too big to import from Wordpress.    

But I can't pretend it hasn't left a gap, and I always intended to start writing casually again. Hopefully I'll 
be able to keep it more succinct and more fun. Expect fewer detailed race reports, a more curated selection of photos,
and more biology.
