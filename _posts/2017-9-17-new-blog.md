*Brendan skiing Ulrich's Couloir off the summit of [Mt. Stuart] this May.*
  
It's been over a year since I last posted at [Beyond the Ranges](http://beyondtheranges.wordpress.com.).
I'm a little sad about this. My old blog was a labor of love, a reminder that I love taking photographs, 
and the archive of a half decade of adventure between the end of college and the present day. There are a number of reasons I couldn't keep it up:
Writing for *The Stranger* and my subsequent increase in freelancing activity certainly cut in to my desire 
to pen 3000-plus carefully considered words about sliding on snow. 
My own interest in reading about running and skiing has
decreased lately. Blogs in general appear to be a thing of the past. 
I needed to start a real professional website (this one), which became my primary home
on the internet, but *BTR* proved a bit too big and clunky to import from Wordpress.    

I can't pretend I haven't missed it, though, and I always intended to start writing casually again. Hopefully I'll 
be able to keep it more succinct and more fun, for longer. Expect fewer detailed race reports, 
a more curated selection of photos, and more biology. I'll try and get a comments section up soon -- thanks to everyone 
who's stopped by over the years.
