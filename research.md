As an empirically-minded evolutionary biologist and ornithologist, I work to describe 
patterns of avian biodiversity and the processes responsible for them. What role does 
selection across environmental gradients play in speciation in birds? How do differences 
in dispersal ability affect population genetic structure? To address these questions, 
I use a variety of tools from computational genomics to basic natural history. 
I’m particularly interested in the birds and ecosystems of the broader New Guinea region and 
western North America.

## Speciation and elevational gradients

My dissertation work investigates the role of natural selection in the recent divergence of 
New Guinean tree kingfishers _Syma torotoro_ and _Syma megarhyncha_, sister species that 
replace each other along elevational gradients. While elevational replacements are widespread 
in tropical mountains, which are often the site of dramatic changes in environment along 
elevational gradients, it's unclear whether differential selection pressures across these 
gradients are sufficient to cause speciation in groups generally thought to have high gene 
flow, such as birds. To test this hypothesis in _Syma_, I'm investigating island-wide patterns of 
genetic and morphological differentiation in both taxa, conducting species delimitation, and 
reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among geographically distinct populations. 
I’ve also been evaluating methods to [collect genome-wide SNP data from museum specimens](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/16/100867). 

## Phylogeography and population genomics

The basis of all organic evolution is a change in the allele frequencies of a 
specific gene in a specific population. Phylogeography, or the spatially-explicit study of 
genetic variation across landscapes, is therefore a powerful tool to shed light on the 
correlation between geographic and environmental processes and genetic differentiation. 
Previously, I’ve studied influence of dispersal ability and migratory route on phylogeographic 
patterns in [White-eyes](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2015.08.018) and 
[Painted Buntings](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/05/132910).

## Museum specimens and natural history

Natural history museum specimen collections are an underutilized source of 
huge amounts of biological data, with the potential to inform research in fields ranging 
from systematics and taxonomy to virology and toxicology. In addition to using vouchered 
tissues in phylogenetic research and 
<a href="https://beyondtheranges.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/uwbm-collecting-expedition-wa-and-idaho/"> 
actively contributing to collecting efforts and specimen preparation</a> at the Burke Museum, 
I have used aggregated specimen records to [infer migratory patterns](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.1871) 
in Painted Buntings (_Passerina ciris_). Similarly, despite centuries of effort, 
we lack basic distributional, ecological, and behavioral data for bird species in many 
regions of the world. Filling in these gaps with field observations will always be 
[a fundamental part of my research program](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309534829_Notes_on_birds_and_logistics_from_the_south_side_of_Mount_Giluwe_SHP).
