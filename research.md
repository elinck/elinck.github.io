I’m a biologist and science writer interested in environmental ethics and the forces shaping the distribution of genes and species. Most of the time I study mountain birds, which face compounding threats and are a useful system for disentangling the impacts of geography and environment on genetic variation. Understanding biogeographic patterns at any level of biological organization requires linking historical processes (like speciation) with present-day ecological realities (like habitat fragmentation or temperature). It also provides the basis for management interventions and forecasting responses to future climate warming.

My background spans ecology, population genomics and phylogenetics, and physiology. I value natural history museums and natural history, reproducibility and best practices in scientific programming, and writing clearly about science for diverse audiences. Equally important to me is examining what science does and does not mean for the world we live in, particularly when it comes to balancing conservation philosophy and practice. I usually work on projects related to one of the following themes:  

### Genetic differentiation and gene flow in mountains  

Mountains are biodiversity hotspots. They are also geographically complex landscapes with pronounced environmental gradients over small spatial scales. Do distinct populations and new species primarily arise from random neutral divergence across geographic barriers or by adaptive divergence into new ecological niches? My dissertation work addressed this question by 1) using genomic data to test a hypothesis of parapatric speciation in kingfisher taxa inhabiting different niches [(Linck et al. 2020, *J. Evol. Biol.*)](https://doi.org/10.1111/jeb.13698) and 2) modeling how climatic cycles drive population divergence in the face of periodic gene flow ([Linck & Battey 2019, *bioRxiv*)](https://doi.org/10.1101/758664). I also have a longstanding interest in the phylogeography of montane species complexes ([e.g., Linck et al. 2019, *Syst. Biol.*](https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syz027)).  

### Ecology and evolution of species ranges  

Distributions are clearly correlated with environmental variables like temperature and oxygen availability, but the extent to which genetic and physiological constraints influence range limits in endotherms remains an open question. I recently found that plasticity and variation in functional traits predicted elevational range breadth in 100+ Andean bird species [(Linck et al. In press *Am. Nat.*)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462673), and continue to study the genetic basis for adaptations to hypoxia within a subset of them. I'm now expanding on this interest in the intersection of ecophysiology and population genetics in a collaboration with colleagues at University of Montana and CU Boulder to understand how metabolism and admixture shape distributions and species limits in chickadees across a latitudinal gradient.  

### Biological responses to climate warming  

Anthropogenic climate warming is a grim global experiment in the forces shaping species ranges. Predicting its effect is a grand biological challenge of the 21st century. I have argued that adopting an evolutionary perspective is crucial to this task: specifically, that if takes millennia for tropical species to evolve into new climatic zones, there is little reason to expect them to rapidly adapt to novel temperature regimes [(Linck et al. 2022, *Biol. Lett.*)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2021.0363). I've also worked to better understand where species are moving upslope the fastest [(Mamantov et al. 2021. *Glob. Ecol. Biogeog.*)](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13246), and helped to develop community science initiatives to improve our baseline monitoring of avian elevational distributions—a project that was recently featured on the front page of the [*Albuquerque Journal*](https://www.abqjournal.com/2410406/birding-with-a-purpose-ex-project-enlists-nm-watchers-to-help-researchers-examine-mountain-population-changes.html).  

### Science, conservation, and values

I study biodiversity because I think it has intrinsic worth. I also like to think that the research I do produces knowledge that is useful to the broader world, and especially to conservationists and policy makers. But not everyone shares my belief that species are an end unto themselves, and my research findings are beside the point when management decisions and environmental crises hinge on competing value systems. I regularly grapple with the gray area where science butts up against society and environmentalism in [my newsletter *treethinking*](https://ethanlinck.substack.com/) and long-form essays for national magazines. In the past few years I've written about the role of recreation in conservation (["Your Stoke Won't Save Us"](https://www.hcn.org/issues/50.8/recreation-your-stoke-wont-save-us)) and democracy and wolf reintroduction (["Throwing Wolves to the Vote"](https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.3/south-wolves-colorado-throws-wolves-to-the-vote))—both for *High Country News*—and reported on [Indigenous-led conservation initiatives](https://www.biographic.com/where-the-rainforest-meets-the-road/) as a photographer for *bioGraphic*.
