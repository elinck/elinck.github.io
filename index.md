Iâ€™m an evolutionary biologist interested in the processes that generate and maintain biological diversity. I tend to see things through the lens of population genetics. Now a postdoc in the [Sheldon Lab](http://www.biogeographyresearch.org/) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Washington, working in the [Klicka Lab](https://klickalab.com/).

I'm also a freelance writer and photographer whose work has appeared in the *The Los Angeles Review of Books*,
*High Country News*, and *bioGraphic.* I've written about the relationships between [humans
and the natural world](https://www.hcn.org/issues/50.8/recreation-your-stoke-wont-save-us), and between [science and politics](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/darwinian-sexual-selection-and-the-politics-of-beauty/). You can read [more about my research here](research), or [see my publications, popular writing, and CV here](cv).
