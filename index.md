Iâ€™m an evolutionary biologist and ecologist interested in how landscapes structure biological diversity from gene to genera. Now a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biology in the [Witt Lab](https://www.unmornithology.org/) at the University of New Mexico, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Washington, working in the [Klicka Lab](https://klickalab.com/).

*High Country News*, and *bioGraphic.* I've written about [wolves and democracy](https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.3/south-wolves-colorado-throws-wolves-to-the-vote), [recreation and conservation](https://www.hcn.org/issues/50.8/recreation-your-stoke-wont-save-us), and [science and politics](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/darwinian-sexual-selection-and-the-politics-of-beauty/).
