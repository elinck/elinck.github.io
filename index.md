Iâ€™m an integrative evolutionary biologist and ecologist interested in how climate and landscapes structure biological diversity from gene to genus. Now a NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Biology in the [Witt Lab](https://www.unmornithology.org/) at the University of New Mexico, I received my Ph.D. from the University of Washington, working in the [Klicka Lab](https://klickalab.com/).
