I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Klicka Lab](https://klickalab.com/) at the University of Washington Department of Biology,
and a freelance writer with bylines in *Jacobin*, *The Stranger*, *High Country News*, and elsewhere. 
I’m broadly interested in how landscapes shape the evolutionary processes responsible for 
biodiversity, and how [culture, politics](http://www.thestranger.com/authors/23759410/ethan-linck), and the [history of science](http://www.hypocritereader.com/59/mayr) shape our relationship 
with the natural world. You can read [more about my research here](research), or [view my CV here](cv).
