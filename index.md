I’m a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Klicka Lab](https://klickalab.com/) at the University of Washington Department of Biology,
where I (mostly) study the evolutionary genetics of mountain birds. I'm also a freelance writer with bylines in *The Los Angeles Review of Books*, 
*Jacobin*, *The Stranger*, and elsewhere. I spend a lot of my time thinking about how landscapes shape the processes responsible for 
biodiversity, and how [culture, politics](http://www.thestranger.com/authors/23759410/ethan-linck), and the [history of science](http://www.hypocritereader.com/59/mayr) 
shape our relationship with the natural world. You can read [more about my research here](research), or [view my CV here](cv).

In my free time, I’m also an [trail runner and backcountry skier.](running)
