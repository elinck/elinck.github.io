Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Klicka Lab](https://klickalab.com/) at the University of Washington Department of Biology,
where I study the intersection of ecology and evolutionary genetics in mountain birds. I'm also a freelance writer whose
work has appeared in the *The Los Angeles Review of Books*, 
*Jacobin*, and *The Stranger.*

Mostly, I spend my time thinking about how landscapes shape the processes responsible for 
biodiversity, and how [culture, politics](http://www.thestranger.com/authors/23759410/ethan-linck), and the [history of science](http://www.hypocritereader.com/59/mayr) 
shape our relationship with the natural world. You can read [more about my research here](research), or [view my CV here](cv).
