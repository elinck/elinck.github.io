Iâ€™m an evolutionary biologist and population geneticist interested in how ecology, geography, and demography interact
to shape genomes and generate biological diversity. Currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Klicka Lab](https://klickalab.com/) at the University of Washington Department of Biology, 
I'll be defending my disseration in May 2019.

I'm also a freelance writer and photographer whose work has appeared in the *The Los Angeles Review of Books*, 
*High Country News*, *The Stranger*, and *bioGraphic.* I spend a lot of time thinking about the relationships between [humans
and the natural world](https://www.hcn.org/issues/50.8/recreation-your-stoke-wont-save-us), and between [science and politics](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/darwinian-sexual-selection-and-the-politics-of-beauty/). You can read [more about my research here](research), or [see my publications, popular writing, and CV here](cv).
