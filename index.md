I'm a biologist with a Ph.D. from the University of Washington. I study the forces that shape the distribution of species and genetic variation, mostly in birds. I'm currently a postdoc in the [Carling Lab](https://www.unmornithology.org/) at the University of Wyoming. I'll be starting as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology at Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/ecology/) this August. If you're interested in joining my lab, [please get in touch](mailto:ethanblinck@gmail.com)!

I'm also a writer. My work is usually about science, environmentalism, and values, and has appeared in the [*The Los Angeles Review of Books*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/darwinian-sexual-selection-and-the-politics-of-beauty/), [*High Country News*](https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.3/south-wolves-colorado-throws-wolves-to-the-vote), and [*The Hypocrite Reader*](https://www.hypocritereader.com/96/cataclysms-desolate). I have a newsletter called [treethinking](https://ethanlinck.substack.com/).
